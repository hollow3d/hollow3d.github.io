            Iâ€™m Jan, 26 year old web developer from Poland. Iâ€™m that guy on the
            picture enjoying Thai Wake Park and trying to wakeboard for the
            first time - it was a blast! Anyways, back to serious stuff, during
            my business studies at college I got interested in building
            websites. After graduating I worked for roughly a year as a UX
            Project Manager in an e-commerce company. As my job involved working
            with UX designers and developers, my interested in web development
            increased further - I started learning more and more in my free time
            after work and at some point I decided to change my career and
            pursue my passion - making great web experiences, this time as a
            developer. Currently Iâ€™m in Berlin, Germany, where I joined a coding
            bootcamp and Iâ€™m looking for new job opportunities.
